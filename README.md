# MovieAppChallenge.

Mobile movie application to access a wide selection of movies online.

## Software architecture
### Layered architecture
For the proposed challenge we used a layered architecture, where we tried to separate each important layer such as presentation, business and data. The layers communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, which allows a clear separation of responsibilities and greater ease of maintenance and scalability of the application.

### Design pattern
In addition to this architecture, the BloC design pattern is used to separate the business logic from the user interface. It also allows the application to react to external events and update the user interface accordingly.

The combination of the layered architecture and the BloC design pattern in Flutter allows for improved modularity and makes the development and maintenance process easier and more scalable.
